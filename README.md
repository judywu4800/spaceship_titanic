# Project: Space Titanic  - Survival Prediction

This is the  final project for STAT GU4241 Statistical Machine Learning

Term: Spring 2022

+ Project summary: This project used the fictional dataset from Kaggle Competition [Spaceship Titanic
](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic), which records the interstellar passenger's information on a spaceship that was traveling to three newly habitable exoplanets and had an accident. The project aims at constructing binary classification models to predict whether passengers on the spaceship  were transported to an alternate dimension, which would be beneficial for retrieving and rescuing process. In the project, EDA was conducted and algorithms including LDA, KNN. Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting was used to build predictive models. The highest prediction accuracy is around 80 percent among these models.
